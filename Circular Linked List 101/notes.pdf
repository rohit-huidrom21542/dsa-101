in circular LL, last node points back to the head node

Empty CLL=> head = NULL
1 node CLL=> head->next=head

Advantages of CLL: 
    1. We can traverse the whole list from any node
    2. implement of algos like Round Robin
    3. We can insert at the beginning and end by just maintaining one tail reference/pointer

Disadvantages of CLL:
    1. Implementation of operations become complex
