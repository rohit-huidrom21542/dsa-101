in DLL, each node points to 2 nodes: previous and next node

advantages of dll:
 1. can be traversed in both directions
 2. a given node can be deleted in O(1) time with given reference to it
 3. insert/delete before a given node
 4. Insert/delete from both ends in O(1) time by maintaining tail

disadvantages: 
 1. extra space for prev
 2. code becomes more complex


Circular Doubly Linked Lists:
 1. previous of head is last node
 2. next of last node is head

Advantages of  Circular Doubly Linked Lists:
 1. we get all advantages of circular and doubly Linked Lists
 2. We can access last node in constant time without maintaining extra tail pointer or reference
